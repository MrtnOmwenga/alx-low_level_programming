# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX-Africa SE. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

- 0x00. C - Hello, World
- 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
- 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
- 0x03. C - Debugging
- 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
- 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
- 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
- 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
- 0x08. C - Recursion
- 0x09. C - Static libraries
- 0x0A. C - argc, argv
- 0x0B. C - malloc, free
- 0x0C. C - More malloc, free
- 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
- 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
- 0x0F. C - Function pointers
- 0x10. C - Variadic functions
- 0x11. C - printf
- 0x12. C - Singly linked lists
- 0x13. C - More singly linked lists
- 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
- 0x15. C - File I/O
- 0x16. C - Simple Shell
- 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists
- 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries
- 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
- 0x1A. C - Hash tables
- 0x1C. C - Makefiles
